# NeuroNexus C++ Programming Internship

This repository contains my solutions for the C++ Programming Internship offered by **NeuroNexus Innovations**. The internship involves completing at least two programming tasks in C++ to gain hands-on experience and enhance coding skills.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Simple Calculator
A basic calculator program that performs the following operations:
## ✅ Features

- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division (with zero-check)  
- % Modulus (integers only)  
- ^ Power  
- √ Square Root  

Users are prompted to enter two numbers and select an operation.

**File:** `calculator.cpp`

### 2. Number Guessing Game
A console-based number guessing game where:
- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user guesses until the correct number is found.
- Hints are provided if the guess is too high or too low.
- The program tracks the number of attempts.
- After guessing correctly, the user is asked if they want to play again.

**File:** `number guessing.cpp`

## 🎥 Demo
A demonstration video of these projects will be uploaded and shared on LinkedIn with the hashtag **#neuronexus**.
